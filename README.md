# Hi-Toyz
Lab project I did for the Human and Computer Interaction course in Binus University (_COMP6800001 - Human and Computer Interaction_). 

Here, I developed a responsive toy store website, "HI-Toyz," using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
The website includes features like navigation menus for both mobile and desktop views, product showcases with hover effects, and interactive elements such as an expandable mobile menu. The design is optimized for responsiveness with media queries, enhancing accessibility across different devices.
