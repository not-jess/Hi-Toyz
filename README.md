# Hi-Toyz
Lab project I did for the Human and Computer Interaction course in Binus University (_COMP6800001 - Human and Computer Interaction_). 

Hi-Toyz is a responsive toy store website developed using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The website includes features like navigation menus for both mobile and desktop views, product showcases, and interactive elements such as an expandable mobile menu.
