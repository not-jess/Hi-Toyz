# Hi-Toyz
Lab project I did for the Human and Computer Interaction course in Binus University (_COMP6800001 - Human and Computer Interaction_). 

Here, I developed a responsive toy store website, "HI-Toyz," using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
The project includes a mobile-friendly navigation menu, image galleries, and interactive content using media queries and flexbox layouts. 
CSS and JavaScript are also utilized for an enhanced user experience with hover effects, animations, and a smooth scrolling experience.
